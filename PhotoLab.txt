Crop:
    first Create and Image crop with width = W, Height = H for the crop image, assert image. then compare the crop image make sure
    the height and width will not exceeds the ImageWidth, and ImageHeight. If so, make the new crop W = ImageWidth -x,
    H = ImageHeight - y; In the for loop getPixelRGB value for the new crop image and SetRPixelGB. In the last step, delete
    the image and return the cropImage.
Resize: 
    First create a RosizeImage with width = newWidth, height = newHeight, assert. Then set scaleXY based on the formula
    given. Set x2, y2 to the width and height for Resize. SetPixelRGB, delete image,and return Resized Image.
Watermarker:
    First assert image, define the watermark's width and height. In the for loop wm_x = x % wm_width; this step
    is to see if the marker imagei is larger than the image, the GetPixelRGB value for wartermarker image. 
    if the colors have the value 0 at position x,y in the watermark template image, multiply the RGB pixel values with the 
    factor 1.45 in the original image at position x,y. Check the RGB pixel and see if they larger than 255, if so the new
    pixel RGB is 255.
Brightness and Constrast:
    First create BnC with ImageWidth and ImageHeight,assert image, in the for loop first get the pixvelvalueRGB, the add
    brightness vakue into it, and make sure if they are in range [0:255]. The new_pixelvalueRGB = pixelvalueRGB * factor.
    Check if new_pixelvalueRGB is in range of [0:255]. SetPixelRGB, Delete image, return BnC.
